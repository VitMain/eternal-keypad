# Frequently Asked Questions

**How can I type on this keyboard?**

> *This device isn't meant for typing, think of it as a gaming controller. That's why it's called a keypad.*

**Why is the lefty layout a reversed qwerty?**

> *The mirrored layout stems from the fact that the right and left hand are "mirrored" between each other; by reflecting the keys that right-handed users press with their left hand it allows left-handed people to use the default layout and key-binding of games and the same hand-movements (specular) that right-handed people normally use.*

**Is there a version for right-handed people? Is the PCB reversible?**

> *Yes, you can assemble all components on the opposite side of the PCB as well as the case plates, and use the default layout. The result will be a device that you can use with your left hand. (regular qwerty layout)*

**What games can I play with it?**

> *It can work for any game, but it works best with first-person or third-person games.
I do not recommend it for games where you don't use the mouse (both hands on the keyboard).*
