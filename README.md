# ETERNAL Keypad
## Scope of the project
The objective is to create an input device for gaming that can be assembled for both right and left hand mouse users.  
This would be especially beneficial for left hand mouse users, allowing them to have a more comfortable gaming experience
without requiring an effort in remapping controls.

### Right hand mouse users:
