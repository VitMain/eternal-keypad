# ETERNAL Keypad
## Scope of the project
Eternal Keypad is an **open-source input device for gaming** that can be assembled for **both right and left hand mouse users**.  

Historically there has been a scarcity of input devices for people that use their keyboard with their right hand and the mouse with the left, forcing some people to place their right hand in uncomfortable positions and/or requiring heavy remapping of in-game controls.  
This device aims to fill this gap in the market that companies don't care about because the target is too small to turn a profit.

The PCB is reversible, this means that components can be installed on both sides of the PCB, allowing it to be used by both left and hand handed users.

## Schedule
- [x] Design the first alpha version
- [x] Pick a name
- [x] Pick a logo 
- [ ] Add holes for mouting hardware or space for gaskets
- [ ] Copy the silk screen on the PCB back
- [ ] Order the first prototypes (eta ~ November)
- [ ] Write the firmware
- [ ] Tag the version and publish the first release
- [ ] Testing phase!
