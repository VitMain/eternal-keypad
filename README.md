# ETERNAL Keypad
## Scope of the project
Eternal Keypad is an **open-source input device for gaming** that can be assembled for **both right and left hand mouse users**.  

Historically there has been a scarcity of input devices for people that use their keyboard with their right hand and the mouse with the left, forcing some people to place their right hand in uncomfortable positions and/or requiring heavy remapping of in-game controls.  
This device aims to fill this gap in the market that companies don't care about because the target is too small to turn a profit.

The device is Pro-micro compatible, so it's easier to build and source components.

## Schedule
- [x] Design the first alpha version
- [x] Pick a name
- [x] Pick a logo 
- [x] Add holes for mouting hardware ~~or space for gaskets~~
- [x] Copy the silk screen on the PCB back
- [x] Order the first prototypes (eta ~ November)
- [x] Write the firmware
- [x] Tag the version and publish the first release
- [ ] Testing phase!

Note: The "A" and "D" keys are not mirrored to avoid inverting movement controls with default key-bindings.
